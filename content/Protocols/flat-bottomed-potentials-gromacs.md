Flat bottomed potentials (FBPs) are a unique type of restraint we can apply to specific particles in a molecular dynamics simulation. 

In short, we define **a fixed geometric region within the simulation box to which certain atoms will either be attracted or repelled**.

They're also a little tricky to understand from a technical perspective.

In this post, I'll briefly discuss the [maths](#the-maths), [how to implement](#implementation) an FBP in the [topology](#topology-file) and [restraints](#restraints-file) files, and finish up with some [practical notes for usage](#some-practical-notes). 

## The Maths
As we can see from the GROMACS manual, the general equation for an FBP is given as:
$$
V_{fb}(r_i) = \frac{1}{2}k_{fb}[d_g(r_{i};R_{i}) - r_{fb}]^2 H[d_g(r_{i};R_{i}) - r_{fb}]
$$
with the most important parameters being:

- $d_g(r_{i};R_{I})$, the geometry of the shape we wish to define (FBPs can be spheres, cylinders, or layers, see the [GROMACS manual](https://manual.gromacs.org/2024.2/reference-manual/functions/restraints.html#flat-bottomed-position-restraints) for more info on the shapes).
- $r$, the radius of our shape. **A negative radius keeps atoms outside of our FBP region, a positive radius keeps them within**.
- $k$, the force constant applied to the chosen atoms when they are not **inside or outside** of our chosen shape.
- $H$, the Heaviside step function which "turns on" the force constant once a restrained atom leaves the FBP region.

Now, let's have a look at an image from the GROMACS manual:

![](https://manual.gromacs.org/2024.2/_images/fbposres.png)

Figure A shows a "positive" (non-inverted) FBP, which **keeps a chosen atom within a certain shape**, by applying a force of $k$ if the restrained particle strays outside of the radius $r_{fb}$.

Figure B shows a "negative" (inverted) FBP, which instead **keeps the particle away from the shape**.

## Implementation
Now, what makes FBPs in GROMACS rather annoying from a technical perspective is the need to split the definition across two files:
1. a section in the `.itp` topology file **defining the shape, radius, force constant**, as well as the specific **atoms to be restrained**.
2. a `restraints.gro` file which **contains the x, y, and z coordinates** of our FBP region for a given atom

To show how the two work together, consider this example from one of my previous projects ([GitHub](https://github.com/MoMS-MMSB/lipid_sorting), [Publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.mie.2024.03.022)), in which we use FBPs to define a pore region in a coarse-grained (Martini 3) membrane tubule, to stop lipids from passing through the pore.

### Topology File
To make these pores, I wanted two cylindrical FBPs crossing the box, one in x, one in y. By defining a negative radius of -2.5nm, I'm keeping the restrained molecules out of the FBP geometries. And I wanted a strong force constant, k=5000 (where k=$KJ \cdot mol^{-1}\cdot nm^{-2}$). 

I define all of these in the **itp file for the molecule I want to restrain** (here, my coarse-grained phospholipid).

```

       05      2      7  -2.5   5000
       06      2      7  -2.5   5000
       07      2      7  -2.5   5000
       08      2      7  -2.5   5000
       09      2      7  -2.5   5000
       10      2      7  -2.5   5000
       11      2      7  -2.5   5000
       12      2      7  -2.5   5000
#endif
```
Where the columns correspond to:

1.  The atom number within the molecule I'm restraining. 

2. The function type: here, we put a 2 for all entries, which is the function type for FBPs under the `[position_restraints]` directive.

3. The shape (g) of the FBP. Here, I'm using `6` for a cylinder spanning the x-dimension, and `7` for a cylinder spanning the y-dimension.

4. The radius $r$ of the FBP.

5. The force constant $k$.

This is a nice example, as we can see that we can define multiple FBPs on the same particle.

### Restraints File
However, you may notice that we haven't yet centered the FBP anywhere! This is where the `restraints.gro` file comes in.

A snippet from my `restraints.gro` file looks like this:
```

  29.59805  29.59805  10.00000
```

Since I'm **restraining the POPC** lipids, I define the FBP center of geometry on the POPC particles/atoms as x,y,z in the gro file coordinates. 

Since I'm **not restraining the water (W)** molecules, they can simply be left as is.

On my [github](https://gist.github.com/jacksoncrowley/cdb4dffaefd14edd2a44f12b54e45b83) I have a script that will take care of this, which would generate a restraints file from your starting structure file, which would be run as:

`python gen_gromacs_restraints.py -c $INPUT_GRO -r POPC -r POPE -x 14.799 -y 14.799 -z 5`

## Some practical notes
- **A given particle can have multiple FBPs placed upon it, but they all must come from the same set of coordinates** as found in the `restraints.gro`. 
- **A poorly placed flat-bottomed potential will probably cause your system to explode immediately**. If a system suddenly has a force of 5000 kJ/mol/nm^2 applied to every molecule in a given region, don't expect it to respond kindly. 
- As such, be **generous with the radius** and **soft with the force constant**, at least at first. It may be a good practice to "grow" your FBP by gradually increasing $r$ and $k$ over a few subsequent simulations. Be kind to your simulations!
- You can check the `.log` file to make sure your FBP is actually running; there should be an entry `Flat-b. P-R.`. If it shows a 0.00000, this means that no particles are currently being affected by the FBPs.
- **If an FBP has been defined in the topology, it will not run without a restraints.gro** file, which is flagged at the `gmx grompp` step with `-r`. If you're not sure if you've got it working properly, try `grompp`-ing without `-r`.
