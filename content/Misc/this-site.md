### Static Generator
This site is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault of markdown notes, generated using the static site generator [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz). I cut out most of the components, such as the side panels and graph view.

I adapted a [module](https://github.com/camargomau/notkesto-site/blob/v4/quartz/components/LinksHeader.tsx) for the links in the header from  [Notkesto](https://notes.camargomau.com/), which I found in the Quartz [showcase](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/showcase).

 I neither know nor intend to learn TypeScript, which Quartz is written in, so all other cosmetic changes are pure CSS.
### Design
The main color is [Wada Sanzo](https://sanzo-wada.dmbk.io)  [Andover Green](https://sanzo-wada.dmbk.io/swatch/andover-green). The header font is [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk), body font is [Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree), and the code block fonts are [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono)
### Inspiration
My main design inspirations come from:
- [Neil Panchal](https://neil.computer)'s website
- [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com)'s website
- The TV Series [Severance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)), which features very nice [typography](https://severance.wiki/typography#:~:text=Manifold%20Extended%20CF,-Manifold%20Extended%20is&text=Manifold%20Extended%20sees%20extensive%20use,company's%20headquarters%20in%20Kier%2C%20PE.)
- The [Business Card Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZVkW9p-cCU) from American Psycho
