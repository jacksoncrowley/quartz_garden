I read a lot. Here's a list of my favourite books, sorted by the year in which I read them, since I started reading again properly in 2019.

These days, I end up spending a significant amount of time _planning_ what I'm going to read; this has been revolutionary. 2024 was the year in which I read the least books, yet I really enjoyed pretty much all of them. Given that I have a tendency to be overly enthusiastic, I've tried to limit myself here to a maximum of three favourites per year. 

Books marked with a \* indicate those which I read when I was younger and reread.
