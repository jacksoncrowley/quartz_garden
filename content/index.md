title: About
---
I'm an Australian PhD Student working in France, where I use [[Coarse Grained]] [[molecular-dynamics|Molecular Dynamics]] simulations to study [[Lipid Droplets]] and [[Membrane Biogenesis]].

I'm a big fan of minimal tech - tending to use plain vim, bash, C, and markdown (all at a middling proficiency). 

Here, you can find:
- [[Protocols]], where you can find all of my technical writing.
- [[Blog]], where you can find all of my _non_-technical writing.

And you can find me:
