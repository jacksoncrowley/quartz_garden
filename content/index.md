title: About
---
I'm an Australian PhD Student in Computational Biophysics, working in France. I use Coarse Grained [[tags/molecular-dynamics|Molecular Dynamics]] simulations to study Lipid Droplets and Membrane Biogenesis.

I'm a big fan of minimal software, tending to use plain vim, bash, C, and markdown; all of which with a middling proficiency. 

Outside of Science, I like to run, read, and write.
